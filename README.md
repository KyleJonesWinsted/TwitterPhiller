This is a simple PWA that sits along side the offical Twitter app on iPadOS. You can add it to your homescreen from Safari by tapping the "Share" button and tapping "Add to Homescreen".

You can choose your preferred background color by double tapping anywhere on the screen. This will cycle through the following modes.

* Always Light: A white background all the time.
* Always Dim: A blue-grey background to match the "Dim" setting in Twitter
* Always Lights Out: A black background all the time.
* Auto Dim: Either white or dim depending on the system wide dark mode setting
* Auto Lights Out: Either white or black depending on the system wide dark mode setting
